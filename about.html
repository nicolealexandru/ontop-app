        <p class="lead">OnTop allows you to stay informed on the clubs that exist within your school 
          while also leaving scheduling and management duties to students. 
          <br></br>
          Once you enroll your school, 
          clubs send requests to be within the school and provide you with a description and their contact 
          information. You can also send out an invitation to club leaders or supervisors so that when those email accounts register on our app, they will automatically be registered in your school.
          You can approve or deny requests, and once a club is approved, you can view it in a 
          schoolwide directory to monitor its announcements and events. 
          <br></br>
          At any time, you can delete an existing club 
          if you deem that its activities are not school-appropriate. Students have the ability to report clubs, and you will be able to view the cause of reportation and either reach out 
          to the club leader involved or delete the club. OnTop uses a secure database to protect all data on the app.

        <p class="lead">OnTop is an app that allows you to communicate effectively to all your club members while also pulling in non-members. 
           <br></br>
          You can schedule events, which automatically show up on club members’ calendars. There’s no need to send out weekly reminders 
          for meetings, either - once you pick a day of the week, our app creates a recurring event on members’ 
          calendars. You can also post announcements on your club page, as well as photos, contact information, and a short summary of your club.
          <br></br>
          OnTop also helps you reach a wider audience by listing your club in a schoolwide directory for 
          everyone to see. With the premium version of the app (paid through the school), you can also view valuable insights into how your club page is being used by students.</p>

        <p class="lead">OnTop allows you to keep track of all your scheduled activities with an easy-to-use interface. 
          You have access to a calendar, a directory of all clubs within your school, and club pages of the clubs you've subscribed to.
        
          <br></br>
          Subscribing to a club is easy - there are no join codes, and once you subscribe, all events from the club will show up on your calendar.
          Look in the "My Clubs" section of your account to see your subscribed clubs and go to their club page. There you can find announcements, photos, and contact information. 
          If you are in multiple clubs, you can color code events to easily distinguish between clubs. 
          You can choose to enable notifications that remind you of upcoming events or tell you when a club has posted an announcement. 
          <br></br>
          If you see something malicious or suspicious happening on a club page, click the report button in the top right hand corner of that club page and type your reasoning. Your administrator 
          will have the ability to address the issue.
